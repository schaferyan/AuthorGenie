# Author Genie App for Android

This is an app to help writers set and track minute and wordcount goals over time. It includes a simple built-in text editor, and a prgoress graph in addition to an interface for adding writing projects/goals and updating achievements. 

## Getting started

The easiest way to try the app is to download it from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanschafer.authorgenie3&hl=en_US&gl=US).

You can also clone the repository, open it in Android Studio, and run the project in an emulator or with a connected device.

## Future Improvements

I'm currently working on some improvements to the app design that will better fit the average use case - including a shift to more of a project based than goal based approach, and an abillity to edit/undo entries.

I'm eventually hoping to migrate to React Native and make the app available for iPhone
